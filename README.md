# Dataset Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster
The Titanic dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the world of machine learning and data science. This dataset contains information about the passengers of the RMS Titanic ship that sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912. The Titanic was the largest passenger ship of its time and was known as the "unsinkable ship." However, tragedy struck when the ship hit an iceberg and caused more than 1,500 people to lose their lives.
